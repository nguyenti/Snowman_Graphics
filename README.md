Snowman_Graphics
================

This is a project for my Graphics class that deals with ray-tracing and 3d rendering.

Implemented features:
* Tacky Snow (Ellipsoids are used instead of purely spheres)
* Carrot nose
* Copper pot hat (you can see the reflection of the Aurora Borealis and 2 objects, a sphere and a cylinder)
* Aurora Borealis
* Postmodern Snowman (hole in the middle. Refer to http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120107032558/candh/images/9/90/Snowman-_Snow_Art_3.png)
